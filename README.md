# ðŸ¤– Automate PyTorch Model Training with Tekton and Paketo Buildpacks

This repository demonstrates building a CI/CD pipeline to fine-tune a GPT-2 model using Tekton pipelines and Paketo Buildpacks. It leverages Buildpacks for containerizationâ€”eliminating the need to manually write and maintain Dockerfilesâ€”and uses Tekton to orchestrate the entire build and training workflow on Kubernetes.

## Why Tekton and Buildpacks?

- **[Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/)** is an open-source CI/CD system native to Kubernetes, enabling reproducible and scalable workflows.
- **[Paketo Buildpacks](https://paketo.io/)** automatically containerizes your applications by detecting runtimes and dependencies, simplifying container image creation without Dockerfiles.
- **[GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)** is a lightweight language model ideal for quick demonstration purposes.

## Repository Structure

- `training_process/`
  - `train.py` â€“ GPT-2 training script.
  - `requirements.txt` â€“ Dependencies automatically managed by Buildpacks.
  - `train.txt` â€“ Small Q&A training dataset.
  - `serve.py` â€“ Script to run the fine-tuned model.
- `untrained_model.py` â€“ Script to demonstrate GPT-2 before training.
- Tekton and Kubernetes configurations:
  - `model-training-pipeline.yaml` â€“ Tekton pipeline definition.
  - `source-pv-pvc.yaml` â€“ PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim.
  - `kind-config.yaml` â€“ Kind cluster setup for local testing.
  - `sa.yml` â€“ ServiceAccount configuration for Docker registry authentication.

## Benefits

- **No Dockerfiles:** Automatic containerization and dependency management.
- **Consistency:** Reproducible builds and training across environments.
- **Efficiency:** Simple maintenance and easy updates.

By leveraging Tekton and Paketo Buildpacks, this pipeline streamlines ML model development and deployment, fostering rapid and reliable experimentation.
